Using Google Trends, you've been asked to generate a report on changes in browser popularity since 2004. There are five browsers you'll be looking into: Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Internet Explorer, and Opera. For the report, you need:
1-Pandas Data manipulation
2-Manipulating time series data. Time series data are data that are indexed by a sequence of dates or times.
3-Basic Time Series Metrics & Resampling
4-Window Functions: Rolling & Expanding Metrics
5-Putting it all together: Building a value-weighted index
