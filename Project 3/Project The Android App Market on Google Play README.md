Project: The Android App Market on Google Play

You work as a Data Analyst for a finance company which is closely eyeing the Android market before it launches its new app into Google Play. You have been asked to present an analysis of Google Play apps so that the team gets a comprehensive overview of different categories of apps, their ratings, and other metrics.
This will require you to use your data manipulation and data analysis skills like:

1. Google Play Store apps and reviews
2. Data cleaning
3. Exploring app categories
4. Distribution of app ratings
5. Size and price of an app
6. Relation between app category and app price
7. Filter out "junk" apps
8. Popularity of paid apps vs free apps
9. Sentiment analysis of user reviews
